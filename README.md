# Salary Prediction Classification
The repository contains the final project of the CS989: Big Data Fundamentals course in Strathclyde Business School's FinTech MSc program.

## Description
Our main objective here was to use one supervised machine learning algorithm and one unsupervised machine learning algorithm on the *salary* dataset to be able to predict salaries.
<br />
For the supervised approach, the [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#:~:text=Decision%20Trees%20(DTs)%20are%20a,as%20a%20piecewise%20constant%20approximation.) algorithm was chosen.
<br />
For the unsupervised approach, the [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) algorithm was chosen.
<br />
It is not the most impressive work, but it is suitable for a fundamentals course.
