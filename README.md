# Salary Prediction Classification
The repository contains the final project of the CS989: Big Data Fundamentals course in Strathclyde Business School's FinTech MSc program. <br />
It has been put here as a way for others to understand to expect and what to do if you're enrolled in an MSc program at Strathclyde that teaches this course.

## Description
For this project, we had to choose a dataset and apply one supervised machine learning algorithm and one unsupervised machine learning algorithm on it. The dataset could either be a public dataset (found in a public repository such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)) or a private dataset.The results and conclusions of using both approaches were also part of the report. <br />
We choose the salary prediction classification dataset, which is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification/data).
<br /> <br />

For the supervised approach, the [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#:~:text=Decision%20Trees%20(DTs)%20are%20a,as%20a%20piecewise%20constant%20approximation.) algorithm was chosen.
<br />
For the unsupervised approach, the [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) algorithm was chosen.
<br /> <br />

No advanced techniques were implemented. This was just us focusing purely on analyzing the dataset and the scope we covered is suitable for a fundamentals course. <br />
